# Sound-Painter
A processing applet that enables the creation of sound effects from scratch with brush-like tools

This scetch is made for ms paint 'artists' like me to create sound effects from basically nothing with a similar workflow
I originally made it for myself, since I didn't want to buy a subscription for any of those 'Pro Tools'
Use WASD to move the waveform left and right and zoom in and out,
use the mouse left click and right click to use the various tools and TAB to switch tools 
use  Z X C V F B to change the tool parameters. hold the keys down while moving the mouse, then release them. pressing shift often
allows for smaller adjustments/slower use

(also this is my first github repo :v)
